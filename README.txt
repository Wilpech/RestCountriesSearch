## How to use
The files included in this repository are here to get you started by giving
you an idea on how you might start the project.

To start the server open a terminal window on unix/linux based systems and change
directory to the project root. Then execute this command:

```
  ./server
```

The command assumes you have a PHP binary in your system path. If you don't you
will get an error and the server will not start.

After starting the server go to:

```
http://localhost:8765/index.html  
```

If you setup the http server differently, please provide direction on how to start it
in your submitted project's readme file.

This operates the same way that was indicated by the prerequisites of the project. The objective of my page was to build the table server-side and send the info to the user so that the table display was seemless, I did not accomplish that but I am proud of what I have produced and the possibilities of what this could be if I ended up fixing it. But for now, it does not function properly but you can see the front end if you like! :)
